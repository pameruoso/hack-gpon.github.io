# BCCTV network

BCCTV (Philippines) is a local Internet Service Provider (ISP) that delivers affordable internet to the masses using EPON technology. The company employs PPPoE to provide internet connections to its clients. The credentials for PPPoE usernames follow a specific format: the customer's surname followed by the last 4 digits of their MAC Address. For example, `JONES4321`. The password is set as `admin` for all users. Most of their ONU devices have default telnet and ssh ports open, with the majority of these devices based on Realtek's `RTL8672`.
