## Serial

The serial port is routed through the USB-C port used for power (which is PD compliant, tested with a notebook power supply). The pins are SBU1 and SBU2, reversal is handled using an open drain buffer (SN74LVC2G07) so a pull-up resistor on RX is needed. On the power daughter board TP7 is TX and TP8 is RX. There is also a USB differential pair routed through the USB-C connector but there is no use for it yet.
At the moment nothing more than a boot log is available. [^bcm61650hack] [^freeboxhack]
